# Pirate Plunder
A fast paced arcade style mini game developed using the Godot game engine, using GDScript. 

## Reason For Creating
I decided to work on this project as its my first time ever working with godot, or a game engine in general. I wanted to show whats possible within just 2-3 weeks of using godot. As you can tell this really is an amazing game engine and editor, and the possibilities are endless with what you can create.
